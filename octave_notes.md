Issue: class-related functions not same as private static methods

http://www.mathworks.co.uk/help/matlab/matlab_oop/specifying-methods-and-functions.html?refresh=true#br2la89

private static methods should use dot notation

My interpretation of the Matlab docs if that calling a static method
should require the class name (or instance) and dot notation
("myclass.mystaticmethod()").

Matlab seems to allow you to be sloppy in this way inside your own class
(or at least I can't find it documented anywhere that you are allowed to do this.)


If really you want to use functions without the dot, there is another
feature: "class-related function" which are also private to the m-file
(and not e.g., methods of the class defined in other m-files).

Comments on existing commits:
- [octave: temporary workaround for f.funs{j}] not quite sure what the error is here, chaining subsref seems to work when I create toy examples
- [silence warning by reordering switch]: no longer produces a warning when fieldnames is called on a classdef
- [TEMPORARY: remove the domain class and replace with domain.m] domain class is deprecated, may not need to implement; still, fixing the subclassing of built-in types might be a good idea
- [octave: use static methods instead of class-related functions] functions after classdefs are now supported in Octave, see https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?41723. There is little difference (in my view) between private static class methods and class-related functions
